MDW - Middleware

Ok, so we're doing the Middle ware WCF service client and application.

What you should know about ServiceLibrary:
--
1. Service Library is using database with the help of Entity Framework
2. How to use Entity Framework? Read about LINQ to understand the basic concept of querying the database.

What should you know about Client application?'

It is very simple, but complex at the same time.

Currently I am having problems calling and responding with events.
